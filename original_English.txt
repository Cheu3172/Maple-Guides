Debugging Maple (Crashes)
First Check: https://maple.software/help/software-issues for a solution to your issue if none is found follow the steps below...
Secondly: If it's "Infinite loading" or "Doesn't inject" or "Crashes on inject" then you didn't follow the steps above correctly!

Please provide the following...

Detail
1. Detail the crash as much as possible if you don't we will most likely ignore you!
2. If possible a screenshot of the error-code (sometimes doesn't appear)

Event Viewer
1. Search up "Event Viewer" and open it
2. Next go to "Windows Logs" and navigate to Application's
3. From there please provide the latest crash indicated by the red circle with "!"; copy it's general details (Do not alter anything) and paste it alongside the report.
Note: Sometimes maple does not generate Event Viewer logs if so then skip this step

Osu!Runtime
1. Open Osu! Folder and navigate to "Logs"
2. Drag and drop "Runtime" into discord and post it alongside your report.

Maple-Runtime
1. Go to search bar and type "Run" (Do not have osu! open during this process!)
2. Type "%appdata%" and navigate to the large randomized folder that has a bunch of random text
3. Then navigate to "Logs" and there you will find "Runtime", drag and drop that file into discord alongside your report.

Recording
1. If possible provide a recording alongside the report and replicate the crash.
2. If Maple crashes alongside another program and said program as a Github (open-source) then please provide it alongside the report.
