// Debugging Maple (Crashes) //
First check https://maple.software/help/software-issues for a solution to your issue. If none are found, proceed with the steps below.

Secondly, if you encounter issues such as "infinite loading," "Doesn't inject," or "Crashes on inject," then you may not have followed the steps above correctly.

Please provide the following:

Details
------------------
Detail the crash as much as possible. If you do not provide enough information, we may not be able to help you effectively.
If possible, provide a screenshot of the error code (which may not always appear).

Event Viewer
------------------
1. Search for "Event Viewer" and open it.
2. Navigate to "Windows Logs" and select "Applications."
3. Provide details of the latest crash indicated by the red circle with an exclamation mark. Copy its general details (do not alter anything) and paste them alongside your report. Note that sometimes Maple does not generate Event Viewer logs; if so, skip this step.

Osu!Runtime
------------------
1. Open the Osu! folder and navigate to "Logs."
2. Drag and drop "Runtime" into Discord and post it alongside your report.

Maple-Runtime
------------------
1. Press the Windows key + R. This will open the "Run" dialog box. (Do not have Osu! open during this process!)
2. Type "%appdata%" and navigate to the large randomized folder that has a bunch of random text.
3. Then navigate to "Logs," where you will find "Runtime." Drag and drop that file into Discord alongside your report.

Recording
------------------
1. If possible, provide a recording of the crash and replicate the issue.
2. If Maple crashes alongside another program and that program is on Github (open-source), please provide it alongside your report.
